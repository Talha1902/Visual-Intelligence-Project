VisualIntelligence-XAI
This project compares the performance of a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Scattering Network (ScatNet) for binary classification of lung cancer histopathological images. It also implements and evaluates an Explainable AI (XAI) method Occlusion to generate attribution maps for both models.

üéØ Objectives
Train a CNN and ScatNet on lung cancer histopathology images (adenocarcinoma vs benign).
Perform k-fold cross-validation to assess generalization.
Compare filters extracted from both models.
Implement an XAI method Occlusion from scratch.
Use Captum library to validate attribution maps.
Analyze and interpret the explainability results.
